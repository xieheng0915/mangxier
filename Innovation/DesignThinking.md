##### Disruptive innovation

_Innovations are constantly occurring in every industry, but to be truly disruptive an innovation must entirely transform a product or solution that historically was so complicated only a few people with a lot of money and skills had access to it. A disruptive innovation is often a much more simple, low-grade solution that’s more **affordable and accessible** to a larger population, which opens it to an entirely new market. This often upturns established industries and overthrows existing market leaders._  

_Disruptive innovations typically take hold at the bottom of the market, meeting the same needs as high-market solutions in a simple and relatively cheap way. They are usually underrated at first, and tend to be seen as **“low-class.”** But due to their low costs and other advantages, they move quickly up the market and eventually become more appealing than their sophisticated competitors._

here are several markers that distinguish true disruptive innovators:

- They are **low-cost and highly accessible**.
- They have **lower gross margins** than their contemporaries or the incumbent.
- They serve a smaller **low-end target market** at first, before expanding to a vast market due to their accessibility.
- They’re hard to see coming and aren’t taken seriously. They quietly, **slowly “climb the ladder”** and can take years or decades to gain traction before they dramatically upend competitors.
