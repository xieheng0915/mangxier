### Summary of technical guide on how to use and implement chatGPT
This book can be downloaded from amazon by free. 

##### Introduction
Fine-tuning and retraing chatGPT on specific tasks and use cases can further improve its performance.  
- set up env
- understand input and outpu formats
- fine-tuning and retraining for specific use cases
- integrating with other systems and platforms
This book is based on GPT-3

##### ch1: intro to gpt-3 and its capabilities
##### ch2: Setting up a dev env for working with chatGPT(GPT-3)
- Software: 
  - python3.6+, 
  - OpenAI's GPT-3 package
  - A valid openAI API key, create an account on openAI website

- install api key in mac
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```
- test installation
```
openai.Completion.create()
```
For detail, check official doc of openai  

##### ch3: Formats for chatGPT
- Input formats: 
  - text
  - prompts: context, question,or task (like chatbot)
  - conditional sampling, eg. you can specify that generated text should have a certain topic, style or length
- Output formats: 
  - JSON obj including: id, choices, score, stop(true: the model is confident in its output)

##### ch4: Fine-tuning and retraining chatGPT
- Fine-tuning: 
Fine-tuning involves training the model on a smaller dataset that is specific to the task or use case. 
- Retraining 
Retraining is the process of training a model from scratch on a specific dataset.   
Retraining is more time-consuming and computationally-intensive process compared to fine-tuning.  
- Best practices
  - Use dataset that is diverse and balanced
  - Use dataset that is of high quality: free of errors and inconsisitencies, should be labeled correctly
  - Use a smaller batch size
  - Monitor the performance 
  - Check official documentation and research papers for the most updated info about fine-tuning and retraining models

##### ch5: Integration of chatGPT with other systems and platforms
- API: one of the most common ways to integrate chatGPT is through the use of APIs.This can include **natural language processing**, **text generation**, and **translation**
- use of pre-trained model: fine-tuning for specific tasks
- virtual assistants, chatbots and customer service applications.
  
##### ch6: Best practices and tips for working with chatGPT
- use pre-processing
- use post-processing
- use evaluation tool: BLEU, ROUGE etc
- use domain-specific language model
- use continuous fine-tuning
